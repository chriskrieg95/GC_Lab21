				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>Before becoming interested in computer programming, I graduated Hope College with a Sociology and Japanese double major. After school, I moved to Japan and worked there for 2 years, working as a kindergarten teacher at a bilingual school and then as a translator at a corporate office in Tokyo. The days when I didn't have anything to translate at my job in Tokyo, I was regularly given clerical duties that involved sifting through large excel files at a time consuming rate. To expedite the process, I began learning how to program simple workflows , using Robotic Processing Automation software, which greatly increased my efficiency and accuracy. I then decided that since my company wasn't going to support me in my programming endeavors, that I was going to learn how to program in Java. I've also been learning Data Science with Python in hopes to supplement my learning along with a background in Java. </p>
