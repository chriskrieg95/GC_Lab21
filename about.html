			<h4>Growing Up</h4>
			<img src="http://movewithmargo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cfiles14875.jpg" height="500px" width="700px">
			<p>Franklin is a small city in Metro Detroit that not many people have heard of. My city's motto is "A town that time forgot," which reflects well of Franklin's character. Although Franklin is surrounded my several large cities and is in close proximity to several large public schools, libraries, and department stores, the city of Franklin has their own quaint public library, post office branch, fire station, and cider mill, just to name a few.</p>
			<h4>Education</h4>

			<p>Immediately after graduation, I moved to Japan where I worked for 2 years as a Kindergarten teacher at an international school and a traslator at a health care company in Tokyo</p>
